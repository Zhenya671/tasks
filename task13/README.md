Task 13. Create catalogue of products and services of some on-line store. Don't 
do UI, but implement back-end logic in OOP. You should create 2 abstract
 base classes for products and services. Products will be TV-sets, 
laptops, mobile phones and fridges. Each product will have name, 
manufactures, release date and cost. Services will be warranty service, 
delivery service, install and configure service. Each service will have 
deadline, run queue and cost. All properties should be declared as ,
non-public, while method to access them should be declared as public. 
User of your catalogue should have the ability to select any product and
 service, read information about them, calculate total cost of selected 
items. Users should not be able to select any service if they didn't 
select any product. But if they select products, you should advise them 
to select appropriate service.
You should use abstract classes, interfaces and traits with inheritance hierarchy and polymorphism.
